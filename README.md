## **👋 About Me**

I am a Technical Writer with a specialized background in **Data Analysis** and **Cybersecurity**. Unlike traditional writers, I bring a "Docs-as-Code" mindset to documentation, treating technical guides with the same rigor as software development.

With a Master's in Data Analytics and a BS in Cybersecurity, I specialize in translating high-level technical specifications—such as API endpoints, security protocols, and data pipelines—into clear, actionable resources for developers and stakeholders. My experience in high-compliance environments (Pharma/FDA) has trained me to produce documentation that is not only easy to read but accurate, secure, and audit-ready.

## **📂 Portfolio Highlights**

### **1. [API Reference: Data Normalization Endpoint](./data-processing-api.md)**

**Skill Demonstrated:** API Documentation (REST, JSON)

* Documented a POST endpoint for a machine learning data pipeline.  
* Includes detailed request parameters, Python code snippets, and JSON response structures.  
* Demonstrates ability to read code and explain parameters clearly to developers.

### **2. [How-to: Configure a Secure Python Environment](./environment-setup-guide.md)**

**Skill Demonstrated:** Developer Guides & Security Compliance

* A procedural guide for setting up a local development environment.  
* Focuses on security best practices (hash checking) and cross-platform commands (Windows/Linux).  
* Demonstrates the ability to write "Runbooks" that reduce support tickets.

### **3. [Concept: Understanding ETL Pipelines](./concept-etl-pipelines.md)**

**Skill Demonstrated:** Technical Explanation & Information Architecture

* A conceptual overview of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) architecture.  
* Written for a mixed audience (Junior Devs & Product Managers).  
* Demonstrates the ability to simplify abstract cloud concepts into digestible content.
